# Angular form testing: Server

This is a simple HTTP service based on Node.js and Express that implements a minimal backend for the sign-up form testing.

## Setup

- Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm start`. The server runs at http://localhost:3000.
- Start the client Angular application in `../client/`. The form uses the HTTP service.
